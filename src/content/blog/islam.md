# Introduction to Islam

Islam is one of the world's major religions, with a vast number of followers around the globe. This religion was founded in the 7th century CE in Mecca, a city in present-day Saudi Arabia.

## Founding and Beliefs

Islam was founded by the Prophet Muhammad, who Muslims believe was the last in a line of prophets that includes figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

Muslims believe in the **Five Pillars of Islam**, which are the foundation of their faith and actions:

1. **Shahada**: Faith in the oneness of God and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad.
2. **Salat**: Five daily prayers that are obligatory for all Muslims.
3. **Zakat**: A mandatory charity contribution.
4. **Sawm**: Fasting during the month of Ramadan.
5. **Hajj**: The pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in a lifetime, if one is able.


## Holy Texts

The primary holy text of Islam is the **Quran**, which Muslims believe is the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad. The **Hadith**, accounts of the Prophet Muhammad's sayings and actions, also play a crucial role in guiding the actions and beliefs of Muslims.

## Conclusion

Islam is a deeply spiritual and communal religion, emphasizing both one's personal connection with God and the importance of caring for others. Through the Five Pillars, Muslims are guided to lead lives of faith, prayer, charity, and pilgrimage.
